Quickstart
==========

This is a series of pages/jupyter notebooks intended to guide a user through the basic functionality and use cases of this library. We will cover the following:

1. Correctly `configuring this library <configuration.html>`_ and the `traffic <https://traffic-viz.github.io/index.html>`_ library it uses,
2. Downloading and preparing `airspace datasets <preparing_datasets.html>`_,
3. `Downloading flights <downloading_flights.html>`_ and saving them to a file,
4. Processing downloaded flights to give a graph of airspace handovers,
5. Visualising the resulting graph and using it to process specific points and flights.
