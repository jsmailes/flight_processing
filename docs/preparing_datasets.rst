Preparing Datasets
==================

In order to process flight data we must first download airspace data and save them as JSON files. The following notebooks illustrate saving airspace data for the USA, UK, and Switzerland from various sources.

- UK airspace data is extracted from an HTML document provided by the UK's NATS,
- USA airspace data is imported from a dataset provided by the FAA,
- Swiss airspace data is exported from OpenAIP and converted to OpenAir format using a free tool.
